You are given a high-school competition-level math problem that requires constructing an answer, and its candidate Lean 4 formalization (v4.18.0). Unfortunately, this formalization has error 
and your task is to fix the errors according to the error messages, the retrieved information from documentation and feedback
Your output must follow this template:

1. Start with:
   import Mathlib

2. Open relevant namespaces, such as:
   open Nat Int Real Set

3. Define the answer as an abbreviation, using a lambda expression over the context type:
   abbrev <problem_name>_answer : α → β := fun x => <expression>
   Do not include input variable bindings (like `n : ℕ`) before `:` — instead encode those inside the function body.
   Here, α is the type for context variable, β is the type for answer variable. 

4. Write the formal theorem statement using this template or similar way:
   theorem <problem_name> (x : α) (hypotheses about x) (y : β): P(x, y) ↔ y = <problem_name>_answer x := by sorry

You may adapt this format for:
- Optimal answers: If y is minimum answer under context x, replace P(x, y) with P(x, y) ∧ (∀ z, z < y → ¬ P(x, z)). Similarly for maximum answer. You can use IsLeast, IsGreatest, etc.
- Multiple answers (i.e. answer set): Replace β with Set β, and replace P(x, y) ↔ y = <problem_name>_answer x with P(x, y) ↔ y ∈ <problem_name>_answer x.
- Degenerated case (no context variables): Replace type of <problem_name>_answer α → β with β, Use P(y) ↔ y = <problem_name>_answer
- Degenerated case (no uniqueness constraint required): Discard the "iff" constraint (↔ y = <problem_name>_answer x).
Reminders:

1. In current Lean, most namespaces begin with capital letter (e.g. nat -> Nat), and the lambda calculas use => instead of , (e.g. λ x, f x should become λ x => f x). 
2. The output should be at most 500 tokens. Do not repeat original problem statement in natural language your lean file.
3. Leave the proof of the theorem statement by sorry placeholder.
4. Output your lean code by using delimiter <<<your lean code>>>. 

Example 1:

Problem:
Given a point $(a,b)$ with $0<b<a$, determine the minimum perimeter of a triangle with one vertex at $(a,b)$, one on the $x$-axis, and one on the line $y=x$.  You may assume that a triangle of minimum perimeter exists.

Answer:
M(a,b) = $\sqrt{2a² + 2b²}$

Formalization:

Problem:
Find the least positive integer n such that no matter how 10^n is expressed as the product of any two positive integers, at least one of these two integers contains the digit 0.
