You are given a challenging high-school competition-level math problem stated in natural language, along with a candidate formalization in Lean 4 (v4.18.0). Your task is to critically evaluate whether the formalized statement faithfully and rigorously captures the original problem. Your feedback must be constructive, specific, and technically accurate.

The template for formalization is as follows:

Please evaluate the formalization using the following criteria:

1. Equivalence (True/False): Does the formalization correctly express the same logic as the informal statement? If the original problem asks for the full set of solutions, is the formalization bidirectional (↔) where appropriate?

2. Minimality/Optimality (True/False): If the problem requires a minimal or maximal solution (e.g., smallest area, greatest number), is this condition correctly captured using Lean constructs such as `IsLeast`, `IsGreatest`, or quantified conditions over comparisons? If the problem does not involve optimality, write True.

3. Clarity and Structure (True/False): Are the types, predicates, and answer functions clearly defined and structured? Are necessary definitions introduced and used appropriately? Are the dependencies between the context and answer types (α → β) well scoped?

After addressing each point above, you must provide a concise justification for your answers.

Finally, provide a decision on whether the formalization should be accepted using the following syntax (for parsing purposes):

<<<True>>>  -- if the formalization is acceptable  
<<<False>>> -- if the formalization should be revised

Be as short as possible. It is OK to directly give <<<True>>> or <<<False>>>.
