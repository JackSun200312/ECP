I have a difficult high-school competition-level math problem and a Python program that enumerates its answers. Your task is to inspect the program and its outputs, determine if it should be accepted, and provide a corrected version if necessary.

Program Requirements:
1. The program should print each answer immediately when found (streaming partial results). Prioritize exact values over approximations. Do not hardcode or state the ground-truth answer, and avoid returning True/False unless explicitly required by the problem.
2. If the problem asks for a minimum or maximum answer, enumerate all candidates up to a threshold, then explicitly output the required extremal answer.
3. If the problem involves parameters, select small sample values, print the parameters used, and enumerate accordingly.
4. Ensure the program can be executed by `python enumerator.py` without requiring any input arguments.
5. Maximize efficiency. Avoid unnecessary computations.
6. The full output must not exceed 400 tokens.
7. Only output the Python program. Optionally use comments inside the code for explanations.

Answer Requirements:
- First, write an explanation about your judgement.
- Then, state whether the original program is accepted or rejected by writing <<<True>>> or <<<False>>>.
- If rejected, immediately provide a corrected Python program enclosed in:
```python
your corrected program
```
